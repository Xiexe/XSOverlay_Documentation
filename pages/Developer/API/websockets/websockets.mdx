# XSOverlay WebSocket API

XSOverlay has a WebSocket based API for interacting with the Notifications, SteamVR, and the overlay itself.

## Configuration

XSOverlay, by default, is configured to listen for WebSocket messages on port `42070`. This can be changed by editing the `ExternalMessageAPIConfig.json` file located in the `[XSOverlayInstallDirectory]/XSOverlay_Data/StreamingAssets/Plugins/Config/` directory.

The following options can be configured:

| Option | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WebSocketPort` | The port XSOverlay listens to WebSocket messages on. | `42070` |


<Callout type="warning">
_XSOverlay **ONLY** listens for messages from the local host. You **CANNOT** currently send messages over the network to a different machine_
</Callout>
***
## API Object / Message Format

All WebSocket messages are sent as JSON objects. The following properties are available:

| Property | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sender` | string | The name of the application sending the message |
| `target` | string | The name of the application the message is intended for. Ex 'xsoverlay'|
| `command` | string | The command to issue to the target |
| `jsonData` | string | JSON Payload with command specific data. See below for endpoint specific for endpoint message formats |
| `rawData` | string | Raw data payload with a singular value in string format like "true", "false", etc. This is mainly used by the UI to do things like setting settings, where the string will be parsed|

## Connecting to the WebSocket
A C# example of connecting to the XSOverlay WebSocket server. This is a C# example, but the same concept can be applied to any language that supports WebSocket and JSON serialization.

<Callout type="warning">
_You must include `client` as a query string in your websocket url. If you do not, the connection will be ignored. e.g. ws://host:port/?client=ClientName_
</Callout>

```cs copy filename="C#"
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
      WebsocketPort = (args.Length == 0) ? 42070 : Int32.Parse(args[0]);
      var exitEvent = new ManualResetEvent(false);
      var wsURL = new Uri($"ws://localhost:{WebsocketPort}/?client=[YOURAPPNAMEHERE]");
      // The format of this URL is very important. Client token needs to be there and should be the name of your application, if a client token is not present, the server will reject the connection.

      // If a client token is already in use, the server will simply add it to a list. This means that if anything sends a message to your client token, it will be sent to everything in that list for the token.
      
      using (Socket = new WebsocketClient(wsURL))
      {
          Socket.Start();
      }
}
```

## Sending a command
After connecting to the websocket, youll likely want to send a command. Below is an example of how to send a notification via the websocket API.
See [API Commands](apicommands) for a list of api commands.

```cs copy filename="C#"
void foobar()
{
    XSONotificationObject notification = new XSONotificationObject(); // See WebsocketAPI / XSONotificationObject for more information
    notification.title = "woah its an example!";
    notification.type = 1;

    XSOApiObject apiObject = new XSOApiObject(); // See WebsocketAPI / XSOApiObject for more information
    apiObject.sender = "xsoverlay";
    apiObject.target = target;
    apiObject.command = "SendNotification";
    apiObject.jsonData = JsonSerializer.Serialize(notification);
    apiObject.rawData = null;

    ws.Send(JsonSerializer.Serialize(apiObject));
}
```

## Subscribing to Events
<Callout>
_Note that subscription tag name is parsed from an enum internally. Spelling matters. Casing is ignored._
</Callout>

Some API events allow you to subscribe to them by passing an array of tags in the `jsonData` field in `XSOApiObject`.
This is useful if you want to continuously get up-to-date information about something without sending a message each time you want an update.
Below you will find a list of available subscription tags, what commands they would map to, and an example of how to subscribe to those tags.

 
### Subscription Tags
| Tag Name | Event |
| --- | --- |
| `DateAndTime` | [RequestDateTime](apicommands#RequestDateTime) |
| `DeviceInformation` | [RequestDeviceInformation](apicommands#RequestDeviceInformation) |
| `Theme` | [RequestThemeUpdate](apicommands#RequestThemeUpdate) |
| `LayoutMode` | [RequestLayoutModeState](apicommands#RequestLayoutModeState) |
| `MediaPlayer` | [RequestMediaPlayerUpdate](apicommands#RequestMediaPlayerUpdate) |
| `Languages` | [RequestUpdatedLanguageList](apicommands#RequestUpdatedLanguageList) |
| `LanguageMap` | [RequestUpdatedLanguageMap](apicommands#RequestUpdatedLanguageMap) |
| `WindowList` | [RequestWindowList](apicommands#RequestWindowList) |
| `ActiveOverlay` | [RequestActiveOverlayInformation](apicommands#RequestActiveOverlayInformation) |
| `Settings` | [RequestGetSettings](apicommands#RequestGetSettings) |
| `Performance` | [RequestRuntimePerformance](apicommands#RequestRuntimePerformance) |

#### Example
```cs copy filename="C#"
void foobar()
{
    List<string> tags = new List<string>()
    {
        "Theme",
        "DateAndTime",
        // ... etc
    };

    XSOApiObject apiObject = new XSOApiObject(); // See WebsocketAPI / XSOApiObject for more information
    apiObject.sender = "xsoverlay";
    apiObject.target = target;
    apiObject.command = "SubscribeToEvents";
    apiObject.jsonData = JsonSerializer.Serialize(tags);

    ws.Send(JsonSerializer.Serialize(apiObject));
}
```

## Unsubscribing to Events
Unsubscribing to events is the same as subscribing, except you send the `UnsubscribeToEvents` command instead of `SubscribeToEvents`.


## Supported Library
A js library is available for interacting with the XSOverlay WebSocket API. You can find it with the file location:
`[XSOverlayInstallationDirectory]/XSOverlay_Data/StreamingAssets/Plugins/api.js`


## Community Libraries
XSOverlay Community members have created libraries for interacting with the XSOverlay WebSocket API in various languages. Below are some of the libraries that are available:

[XSSocket](https://github.com/Duinrahaic/XSSocket) - A C# library for interacting with the XSOverlay WebSocket API.

If you would like to submit your library, please discuss this in the discord in the development-discussion channel.
