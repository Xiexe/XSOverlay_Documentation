<br><br> - _Audio files must be `.ogg` format._
<br> - _Audio files must be named `backspace`, `enter`, `spacebar`, and `tap` respectively._
<br> - _You must include a `soundpackSettings.json` configuration file._

> To create a sound pack, follow the rules above, and place the files into a new folder under the `KeyboardSounds` directory. You can then access the soundpack by hitting the keyboard settings button, and loading it from the list.

# Soundpack Settings
!> `soundpackSettings.json` is a required element of the soundpack, and controls things like volume, and randomizing the pitch of the keyboard typing sounds.

```json copy filename="json"
{
    "settings": [
        {
            // Controls the Minumum allowed pitch when randomizing the pitch for a key press sound.
            "minimumPitchRange": 1,
            // Controls the Maximum allowed pitch when randomizing the pitch for a key press sound.
            "maximumPitchRange": 1,
            // Controls the overall volume of key press sounds.
            "volume": 1 
        }
    ]
}
